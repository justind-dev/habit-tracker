### Tracking Occurrences

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Static files served by nginx
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (client-side only)
- **Deployment**: Docker container with nginx:alpine

### Data Storage
All habit data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ‚úÖ Complete privacy - no data leaves your device
- ‚úÖ No server costs or maintenance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is tied to your specific browser/device
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clearing browser data will reset the app

### Port Configuration
The application runs on port 8080 by default. To change this, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ports:
  - "YOUR_PORT:80"
```

## Development

### Local Development Without Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Serve the `web/` directory with any static file server:

```bash
# Using Python
cd web
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js serve
npx serve web -p 8080

# Using PHP
cd web
php -S localhost:8080
```
